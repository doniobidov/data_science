# Problem 2.3

## Exercises 1-6

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("2_3.jpg")
```

# Problem 2.4

## Exercise 1

```{r}
# Plot price against diameter
ggplot(nambeware, aes(x = Diam, y = Price)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Diameter", y = "Price") +
  ggtitle("Price vs. Diameter")
```

**As the diameter increases, the price also increases. The relationship does not seem to be linear. The variance of price also gets larger with bigger diameter.**

## Exercise 2

```{r}
# Divide samples into different groups according to diameter
nambeware <- mutate(nambeware, Group = cut(Diam, breaks = c(-Inf, 8.25, 10.25, 12.25, 14.25, Inf), 
                                           labels = c("x≤8.25", "8.25<x≤10.25", "10.25<x≤12.25", "12.25<x≤14.25", "14.25<x")))

# Calculate sample mean and sample variance for each group
summary_stats <- nambeware %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(Sample_Mean = mean(Price),
            Sample_Variance = var(Price),
            Sample_Size = n())

# Print the summary statistics table
print(summary_stats)

# Plot the scatter plot of logarithm of group variances against logarithm of group means
ggplot(summary_stats, aes(x = log(Sample_Mean), y = log(Sample_Variance))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Log(Group Mean)", y = "Log(Group Variance)") +
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot of Log(Group Variances) vs. Log(Group Means)")
```

## Exercise 3

```{r}
# Fit a linear model
lm_model <- lm(log(Sample_Variance) ~ log(Sample_Mean), data = summary_stats)

# Extract coefficients
a <- coef(lm_model)[1]
b <- coef(lm_model)[2]

# Print coefficients
cat("Intercept (a):", a, "\n")
cat("Slope (b):", b, "\n")
```

**The relationship between log(variance) and log(mean) is linear with an sloe of 2.33. This means that as mean price increases by a single unit, the variance of price increases by a factor of about 2. This behavior is typical for a *Gamma* distribution.**

# Problem 2.5

## Exercises 1-4

```{r, out.width = "80%", out.height = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("2_5.jpg")
```
