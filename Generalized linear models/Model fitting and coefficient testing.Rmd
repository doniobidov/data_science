# Exercise 3.7

## 1

```{r}
# Fit the Poisson GLM model
glm_model <- glm(Count ~ Species + factor(Quadrat), data = seabirds, family = poisson(link = "log"))

# Extract response residuals for 2nd and 4th observations
resid_2nd <- resid(glm_model, type = "response")[2]  # Response residual for 2nd observation
resid_4th <- resid(glm_model, type = "response")[4]  # Response residual for 4th observation

pearson_2nd <- residuals(glm_model, type = "pearson")[2]  # Pearson residual for 2nd observation
pearson_4th <- residuals(glm_model, type = "pearson")[4]  # Pearson residual for 4th observation

deviance_2nd <- residuals(glm_model, type = "deviance")[2]  # Deviance residual for 2nd observation
deviance_4th <- residuals(glm_model, type = "deviance")[4]  # Deviance residual for 4th observation

quantile_2nd <- qresid(glm_model)[2]  # Quantile residual for 2nd observation
quantile_4th <- qresid(glm_model)[4]  # Quantile residual for 4th observation

cat("Response residual for the 2nd observation:", resid_2nd, "\n")
cat("Response residual for the 4th observation:", resid_4th, "\n")
cat("Pearson residual for the 2nd observation:", pearson_2nd, "\n")
cat("Pearson residual for the 4th observation:", pearson_4th, "\n")
cat("Deviance residual for the 2nd observation:", deviance_2nd, "\n")
cat("Deviance residual for the 4th observation:", deviance_4th, "\n")
cat("Quantile residual for the 2nd observation:", quantile_2nd, "\n")
cat("Quantile residual for the 4th observation:", quantile_4th, "\n")
```

## 2

```{r}
# Find the minimum value of the response variable
min_response <- min(seabirds$Count)

# Print the minimum value
cat("Minimum response:", min_response, "\n")
cat("Sorted response:", sort(seabirds$Count), "\n")
```

The approximate distribution of the Pearson and deviance residuals are expected to be **poor**.

## 3

```{r}
# Obtain standardized deviance residuals
deviance_residuals <- rstandard(glm_model, type = "deviance")

# Obtain fitted values
fitted_values <- fitted(glm_model)

# Plot standardized deviance residuals against fitted values
plot(fitted_values, deviance_residuals, 
     xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Standardized Deviance Residuals",
     main = "Standardized Deviance Residuals vs Fitted Values")

# Add a smooth line
scatter.smooth(fitted_values, deviance_residuals)
```

```{r}
# Plot standardized deviance residuals against fitted values transformed to the constant-information scale
fitted_values_transformed <- sqrt(fitted_values)
plot(fitted_values_transformed, deviance_residuals, 
     xlab = "Transformed Fitted Values", ylab = "Standardized Deviance Residuals",
     main = "Standardized Deviance Residuals vs Transformed Fitted Values")

# Add a smooth line
scatter.smooth(fitted_values_transformed, deviance_residuals)
```

**I don't see any pattern in the plots. However, these plots are not reliable as minimum of the response is equal to 0.**

## 4

```{r}
# Obtain quantile residuals
quantile_residuals <- qresid(glm_model)

# Plot quantile residuals against fitted values
plot(fitted_values, quantile_residuals, 
     xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Quantile Residuals",
     main = "Quantile Residuals vs Fitted Values")

# Add a smooth line
scatter.smooth(fitted_values, quantile_residuals)
```

```{r}
# Plot quantile residuals against fitted values transformed to the constant-information scale
plot(fitted_values_transformed, quantile_residuals, 
     xlab = "Transformed Fitted Values", ylab = "Quantile Residuals",
     main = "Quantile Residuals vs Transformed Fitted Values")

# Add a smooth line
scatter.smooth(fitted_values_transformed, quantile_residuals)
```

**There are no patterns in these plots, which indicates about no violations in systematic component including link function, important covariates, and transformation of quantitative variables.**

## 5

**Using either the standardized deviance or standardized quantile residuals is preferred in these plots because they have approximately constant variance. Standardized quantile residuals are especially encouraged for discrete EDMs to avoid distracting patterns in the residuals.**

# Exercise 3.8

## 1

```{r}
# Fit the Gamma GLM model
glm_model <- glm(Price ~ Diam + Type, data = nambeware, family = Gamma(link = "log"))

# Obtain standardized deviance residuals
deviance_residuals <- rstandard(glm_model, type = "deviance")

# Obtain fitted values
fitted_values <- fitted(glm_model)

# Transform fitted values to constant-information scale
fitted_values_transformed <- log(fitted_values)

# Plot standardized deviance residuals against transformed fitted values
par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # Resetting plotting layout
scatter.smooth(fitted_values_transformed, deviance_residuals, 
               xlab = "Transformed Fitted Values", ylab = "Standardized Deviance Residuals",
               main = "Standardized Deviance Residuals vs Transformed Fitted Values")
```

**Assumptions checked:** systematic component: correct link function, usage of all the important covariates, and correct transformation of quantitative variables.
**Patterns:** slight parabolic curvature
**The GLM assumptions checked are satisfied or violated**: possibly violated.

## 2

```{r}
rW <- resid(glm_model, type = "working") # working residuals
lp <- predict(glm_model) # linear predictor
z <- rW + lp # working response

# Plot working responses against linear predictors
par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # Resetting plotting layout
scatter.smooth(z ~ lp, las = 1, ylab = "Working responses, z", xlab = "Linear predictor")
```

**Assumptions checked:** systematic component: correct link function.
**Patterns:** curvature.
**The GLM assumptions checked are satisfied or violated**: violated. Wrong link function.

## 3

```{r}
rP <- resid(glm_model, type = "partial") # partial residuals
termplot(glm_model, partial.resid = TRUE, las = 1)
```

**Only look at the diam covariate**
**Assumptions checked:** covariate diameter is included on the correct/incorrect scale.
**Patterns:** No curvature.
**The GLM assumptions checked are satisfied or violated**: Not violated.

## 4

```{r}
# Plot Q-Q plot of standardized deviance residuals
par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # Resetting plotting layout
qqnorm(deviance_residuals, 
       main = "Q-Q Plot of Standardized Deviance Residuals")
qqline(deviance_residuals)
```

```{r}
rQ <- qresid(glm_model)
qqnorm(rQ, las = 1, main = "Q-Q plot of Quantile Residuals")
qqline(rQ)
```

**Assumptions checked:** check the random component. Determine if the choice of distribution is appropriate.
**Patterns:** Mostly follows a straight line. One outlier at the end.
**The GLM assumptions checked are satisfied or violated**: Not violated. The plot shows that using a Gamma GLM seems reasonable.

## 5

```{r}
# Obtain Cook's distances
cooks_distances <- cooks.distance(glm_model)

# Plot Cook's distances
par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # Resetting plotting layout
plot(cooks_distances, 
     xlab = "Observation Number", ylab = "Cook's Distance",
     main = "Cook's Distance")
```

```{r}
sort(cooks.distance(glm_model)) 
```

**Assumptions checked:** check if there are any potential influential observations.
**The GLM assumptions checked are satisfied or violated**: Not violated. All observations have the Cookâ€™s distance less than 1, so there are no potential influential observations.
